### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes I felt prepared for the assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I think I had enough time. I was able to finish all the core functionality in a couple hours and actually spent most of my time on the css to improve the design. The only functionality I would add is information about where to watch the full movie and being able to filter by clicking on the genre tags.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went well. I'm still a bit confused about some of the errors I'm getting, but they have been significantly reduced from before and all the functionality of my website works. I'd like to look over those errors if I have time later on.
